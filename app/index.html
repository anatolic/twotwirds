                         While conventional cotton covers around 2,8 % of global arable 
                         land, it accounts for 6,3 % by value of global pesticide sales, 
                         including 12,3 % (!) of global insecticide sales. This is more 
                         than any other major global crop uses, with partly devastating 
                         effects for smallholder farmers, local communities, 
                         and the surrounding environment.

                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph">Luckily, there are alternatives. At Twothirds, we are using a variety of fabrics to omit the use of conventional cotton, namely Tencel™, hemp, linen (or by it’s crop name: flax), and obviously organic cotton. All of those alternatives have different characteristics, which is why we are using them for different purposes. But they have something in common: they use less resources than conventional cotton and have less negative environmental impacts, which in turn is beneficial for everyone involved: soils, rivers and waters, air, as well as local communities and farmers.</p>

                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-5">Within 15 years (from 2000 to 2014) worldwide clothing production doubled (!). At the same time, people buy 60% more clothes and keep them for half as long as 15 years ago. The phenomenon of fast fashion comes with some spectacular numbers. And spectacular social and environmental problems. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="twothirds__h3-chronicle-roman mt-5">We think, the solution towards more sustainable fashion lies not simply in using different fabrics, but also comes with longevity. </h3>
                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-5">And longevity is created through timelessness and quality. Timelessness obviously is a design issue. Quality - on the other hand - is created through a careful selection of all steps when producing clothes: the quality of the raw material, the production processes, the know-how of our suppliers. In order to deliver the highest quality, we keep production as local and centralized as possible. </p>
