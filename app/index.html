At Twothirds, we are using a variety of fabrics to omit the use of conventional cotton, namely Tencel™, hemp, linen (or by it’s crop name: flax), and obviously organic cotton. All of those alternatives have different characteristics, which is why we are using them for different purposes. But they have something in common: they use less resources than conventional cotton and have less negative environmental impacts, which in turn is beneficial for everyone involved: soils, rivers and waters, air, as well as local communities and farmers.</p>

                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-5">Within 15 years (from 2000 to 2014) worldwide clothing production doubled (!). At the same time, people buy 60% more clothes and keep them for half as long as 15 years ago. The phenomenon of fast fashion comes with some spectacular numbers. And spectacular social and environmental problems. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="twothirds__h3-chronicle-roman mt-5">We think, the solution towards more sustainable fashion lies not simply in using different fabrics, but also comes with longevity. </h3>
                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-5">And longevity is created through timelessness and quality. Timelessness obviously is a design issue. Quality - on the other hand - is created through a careful selection of all steps when producing clothes: the quality of the raw material, the production processes, the know-how of our suppliers. In order to deliver the highest quality, we keep production as local and centralized as possible. </p>

By keeping the distances short, the connection to our suppliers is more direct and enhanced by frequent visits. Therefore, we know how our suppliers work and they know how we think. Apart from that, we pay attention to the details. Trimmings, such as zippers and buttons, are a major reason for products to be thrown away. So by using high quality trimmings, we make your products last longer!

                    <p>There is a variety of ways to achieve sustainable fashion, like for example the use of more sustainable materials and production processes, sufficiency, as well as responsible production and consumption. Another important pillar is the recirculation of materials and resources. Currently, one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or incinerated every single second(!). We think that this is a loss of resources. Consequently, we started to use fabrics that include materials from different sources: they can be leftovers from production processes, post consumer waste, materials that have been recovered from the open environment (such as the ocean), and deadstock (fabrics that already have been produced but that are not used by the producer anymore).

Thereby, resources are protected and the CO2 footprint is reduced (for example, for the production of Econyl, a recycled Nylon, around 60% less greenhouse gases are emitted compared to the production of virgin Nylon). Furthermore, our recycled fabrics require less land and consume less water. That‘s a lot of less, isn‘t it?
                        And, on top of it, we are proudly supporting innovative technologies that actually make a difference!

                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-4">Payments and safety are two huge issues in the fashion industry, just remember all the horrible stories from collapsing production sites in Bangladesh. Here, production in Portugal, Italy, and France helps, since the production facilities are regulated under European standards.</p>
                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-4">We can be sure that the paid wages are not only a randomly calculated minimum wage, which equals to the lowest wage workers can be paid. The minimum wage is determined by governments. However, the minimum wage does not necessarily correspond with the living wage, which is the wage a single person needs in order to have a life without monetary problems while all needs are covered). In Portugal and France (in Italy, there is no official minimum wage),the minimum wage is at least as high as the living wage, which is by far not the case in Bangladesh or India!

                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-4">Textile overproduction is a huge problem in the fashion industry. It is unknown, how much clothing is produced and not sold every year. Some estimate that in some big retail chains, about 10% of the garments are not sold. This leads to enormous amounts of clothes lying around. Naturally, this implies wasted fabric, dyes, environmental impacts and so on. Basically, it‘s burdening the environment without benefitting anyone. More cynically, some brands have been reported to burn excess production to make space for new collections. We think that this is irresponsible behavior and disrespectful not only to the people who can‘t afford clothes, but also to the environment. It‘s basically a sign of lack of appreciation.
                        We go into a different direction: we prevent this to happen.</p>

                        The reason for this is as simple as sustainable: by offering the pre-order, we can estimate how much pieces of a specific garment we are going to sell, and subsequently order specific quantities. Therefore, we do not overproduce. </h3>
                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-4 suite-section__text "> Our pre-order system does not only lead to higher resource efficiency and does prevent senseless raw material waste, it also pays off literally in the end: creating less waste materials leads to less costs per produced garments, resulting in lower production costs per garment. This system therefore is part of our solution to providing a fair price to our customers and respecting the value of natural resources.</p>

That means, we use up the things that we produce and order ourselves. Consequently, no deadstock arises from our production. If you don‘t know what deadstock is, here you go: deadstock is an amount of product that a company has bought or made but is unable to sell. For example, fabrics that are ordered by companies but not used to produce garments, become dead stock. There are brands out there who use dead stock to produce own garments (including ourselves), but at the same time, we think that it is the best option to not even produce dead stock. </p>

The same applies to trimmings and all kinds of smaller items that are used in our clothing. First, we use what we have, and then we can think of something new. This makes our production sometimes a little more challenging than it normally would be, but at the same time we‘re being creative with what‘s already there. And we think that this is a capability quite valuable in every part of our lives.

                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-4">Are you familiar with the concept of externalities? An externality is an impact, that is caused by goods productions, the producer is not accountable for. There are two ways of handling externalities: either through payments (e.g. carbon offsetting) or through minimising them, which basically means to strategically improve production processes and the way a company works from a sustainability perspective.
                    </p>
                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph mt-4">
                            While paying for externalities is a hot topic at the moment, in general, it is always recommended to prevent those externalities from occurring, instead of paying for them afterwards. Even more so, since it does not only matter that carbon is removed from the atmosphere, but also where this happens. Furthermore, carbon offsetting does not account for other externalities, such as toxic emissions. This is why at Twothirds we like to support sustainable and green innovation (so-called eco-innovation) on both levels, technical and strategic. They are essential for decreasing our environmental footprints, and to decrease externalities (not only CO2 emissions, but all kinds of externalities).

This is our program to deal with those externalities, and it works as follows: For every order, 1€ is collected and set aside. With this money, we support different projects that improve the sustainability aspects of our supply chain. In practice, this means to collaborate with various actors, such as (research) institutes, different suppliers, and other organizations to fund innovative research on textiles and production processes. It also involves to support suppliers with investments in renewable energy production, which leads to positive effects not only for Twothirds, but also for other brands working with the same facility.
