                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph">Given all the negative consequences,
                         business as usual will not be feasible anymore in the future. 
                         While conventional cotton covers around 2,8 % of global arable 
                         land, it accounts for 6,3 % by value of global pesticide sales, 
                         including 12,3 % (!) of global insecticide sales. This is more 
                         than any other major global crop uses, with partly devastating 
                         effects for smallholder farmers, local communities, 
                         and the surrounding environment.

                    <p class="twothirds__paragraph">Luckily, there are alternatives. At Twothirds, we are using a variety of fabrics to omit the use of conventional cotton, namely Tencel™, hemp, linen (or by it’s crop name: flax), and obviously organic cotton. All of those alternatives have different characteristics, which is why we are using them for different purposes. But they have something in common: they use less resources than conventional cotton and have less negative environmental impacts, which in turn is beneficial for everyone involved: soils, rivers and waters, air, as well as local communities and farmers.</p>
